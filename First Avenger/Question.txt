Suppose an alternate version of MCU.

The universe is under the threat from Galactus. Its finally time to assemble the avengers.
But someone needs to take the initiative. So "this" avenger took the first step of assembling all of them together.
After 2 days of thinking "this" avenger took one day to assemble all the other 41 avengers.
